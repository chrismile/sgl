 * Notes:
 * - Interestingly, on the NVIDIA 525.78.01 driver, the combination useDefaultDisplay = false and createPBuffer = false
 *   failed during tests. This is weird, as createPBuffer = false does not fail when using the default display.
 * - A Vulkan device can be passed. If EGL_EXT_device_persistent_id is available, the device UUID will be used for
 *   initializing the correct context. If it is not available, the Vulkan device will be ignored.
 * - As of 2023-07-06, the NVIDIA 535.54.03 driver seems to have problems with Vulkan-OpenGL interoperability,
 *   causing kernel soft lockups. Consequently, Zink (an OpenGL to Vulkan translation layer) will be used by default
 *   if it is found on the system.
