/**
 * Helpers for camera orientation mode conversions.
 *
 * Documentation regarding yaw, pitch, roll:
 * - The internal order is Roll * Yaw * Pitch.
 * - For legacy reasons, yaw' = 3pi/2 - yaw is used in the interface.
 * - Support for roll was removed, as the yaw-pitch mode is only used with the first-person camera navigator,
 *   which doesn't support roll anyways.
 *
 * Yaw * Pitch = \f[\begin{pmatrix}
 *  cos(y) & sin(y)sin(p) &  sin(y)cos(p) \\
 * 0       & cos(p)       & -sin(p)       \\
 * -sin(y) & cos(y)sin(p) &  cos(y)cos(p) \\
 * \end{pmatrix}\f]
 *
 * Roll * Yaw * Pitch = \f[\begin{pmatrix}
 *  cos(y)cos(r) & sin(y)sin(p)cos(r) - cos(p)sin(r) & sin(y)cos(p)cos(r) + sin(p)sin(r) \\
 *  cos(y)sin(r) & sin(y)sin(p)sin(r) + cos(p)cos(r) & sin(y)cos(p)sin(r) - sin(p)cos(r) \\
 * -sin(y)       & cos(y)sin(p)                      & cos(y)cos(p) \\
 * \end{pmatrix}\f]

 * Roll * Yaw * Pitch = \f[\begin{pmatrix}

 *
 * alpha = roll = atan2(r_21, r_11) = atan2(cos(y)sin(r), cos(y)cos(r))
 * beta = yaw = atan2(-r_32, sqrt(r_32^2 + r_33^2)) =
 *  = atan2(-cos(y)sin(p), sqrt(cos(y)^2 sin(p)^2 + cos(y)^2 cos(p)^2))
 * gamma = pitch = atan2(r_32, r_33) = atan2(cos(y)sin(p), cos(y)cos(p))
 *
 * Due to y' = 3pi/2 - y:
 * - sin(3pi/2 - y) = -cos(y')
 * - cos(3pi/2 - y) = -sin(y')
 * Finally, we have front = Yaw * Pitch * (0, 0, -1)^T = (cos(y')cos(p), sin(p), sin(y')cos(p))^T
