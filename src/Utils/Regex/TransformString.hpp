/**
 * Parses SVG/CSS-like transform strings. The strings are read from left to right.
 * Example: "translation(-1, 2, 1.7) rotate(90째 0 -1 0) scale(1e-3)".
 * Supported commands:
 * - translate(tx, ty, tz): Translation by (tx, ty, tz).
 * - scale(s): Uniform scaling in x, y, z by s.
 * - scale(sx, sy, sz): Non-uniform scaling.
 * - rotate(angle-rad, ax, ay, az): Rotation around axis (ax, ay, az) by passed radians (0 to 2*PI).
 * - rotate(angle-deg째, ax, ay, az): Rotation around axis (ax, ay, az) by passed degrees (0째 to 360째).
 * - matrix(a11, a12, a13, a21, a22, a23, a31, a32, a33): A 3x3 row-major matrix.
 * - matrix(a11, a12, a13, a14, a21, a22, a23, a24, a31, a32, a33, a34): A 3x4 row-major matrix.
 * - matrix(a11, a12, a13, a14, a21, a22, a23, a24, a31, a32, a33, a34, a41, a42, a43, a44): A 4x4 row-major matrix.
 * - matrixc(a11, a21, a31, a12, a22, a32, a13, a23, a33): A 3x3 column-major matrix.
 * - matrixc(a11, a21, a31, a12, a22, a32, a13, a23, a33, a14, a24, a34): A 3x4 column-major matrix.
 * - matrixc(a11, a21, a31, a41, a12, a22, a32, a42, a13, a23, a33, a43, a14, a24, a34, a44): A 4x4 column-major matrix.
 * @param transformString Transform string.
 * @return Parsed 4x4 transform matrix.
